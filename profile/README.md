## Pine64 PineNote Debian

This github organization holds various repositories used to generate Debian images for the Pine64 PineNote (https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PineNote).
As with most of the software for Pine64 devices, this is a purely community-based effort. Please also note that, as of Jan. 2024, the PineNote was only released as a limited early-developer device.

### Notable components
